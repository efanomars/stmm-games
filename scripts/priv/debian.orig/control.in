Description: C++ 2D games library - model classes
 Extensible 2D game library for C++ (C++14).
 .
 This library defines a simple 2D game model based one or more boards of tiles,
 blocks, trivial animations and game events.
 It allows one to customize high scores, options and preferences.
 It also defines interfaces for a view implementation.
