/** Alarms event.
 * Allows one to set a sequence of alarms.
 * Each alarm timeout of the sequence can be defined in relation to the preceding
 * except for the first.
 *
 * The sequence can be subdivided into stages, each of which repeats a certain
 * timeout duration change.
 *
 * When a timeout expires the next is only started as soon as MESSAGE_ALARMS_NEXT
 * is received. To start the next alarm immediately,
 * a typical instance will therefore send a MESSAGE_ALARMS_NEXT to itself (triggered by
 * LISTENER_GROUP_TIMEOUT).
 *
 * If MESSAGE_ALARMS_NEXT is received while an alarm is already active, the message
 * LISTENER_GROUP_TIMEOUT_ACTIVE is sent to listeners.
 *
 * Input MESSAGE_ALARMS_RESTART restarts the whole thing, but only if no alarm is
 * active. If an alarm is active LISTENER_GROUP_TIMEOUT_ACTIVE is sent to listeners.
