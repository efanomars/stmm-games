/** Delayed queue event.
 * Allows to queue incoming values (messages) and output them one by one
 * separated by an interval (with game tick granularity). If the queue exceeds
 * its max size new values are dropped.
 *
 * The interval is the sum of two components, one is in game ticks, the other is in
 * milliseconds, transformed in game ticks according to the current game interval
 * GameProxy::gameInterval(). The interval is always at least one game tick.
 *
 * If no value was output in the last 'interval' ticks, an incoming value is output
 * in the same game tick it is received.
 *
 * The interval components can be changed at runtime.
