/** The game constraints.
 * This class can be used to define the conditions for which a game can be played.
 * This allows game loaders to choose the games that are compatible with
 * the current preferences. For example a game might work only for exactly 2 non AI teams in one level,
 * so a single player (chosen in the preferences) should be prevented from playing the game.
 *
 * GameConstraints is valid only if either all teams play in one level or
 * each team plays in a separate level. Therefore defining a game with constraints
 * (m_nLevelsMax > 1) and (m_nTeamsPerLevelMax > 1) is invalid.
